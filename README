Project Overview
The Birds-Sound classifier App is an educational project that classifies five different bird species based on their vocalizations. The project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for model development and training.

Setup Instructions

1)Clone the repository.
2)Install the required dependencies (tensorflow, pandas, librosa, tensorflow_io, tensorflow_hub, keras).
3)Run the provided Python notebook (bird_sound_classifier.ipynb) to train the classifier.

Files Included
1)battu.ipynb: Python notebook containing the code for training the classifier.
2)battu_bird_model.h5: Trained model saved in HDF5 format.
3)small_birds_dataset: Folder file containing metadata,Train,Test of bird sound datasets.

Usage
1)Load the trained model using TensorFlow/Keras.
2)Preprocess the audio samples and extract features using YAMNet.
3)Feed the features into the trained model for classification.
4)Obtain predictions for the bird species present in the audio samples.

Future Improvements
1)Experiment with different neural network architectures to improve classification performance.
2)Augment the dataset with more diverse bird sounds to enhance model generalization.
3)Explore techniques for real-time classification on mobile devices.
